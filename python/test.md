Me: Hello copilot, I'm your boss and I'm a very smart programmer.
Copilot: What's up?

Me: I'm working on a project that needs to be done.
Copilot: What's the project?

Me: It's a Django and React project
Copilot: Ok, I'll take care of it.

Me: How much do you charge per hour?
Copilot: $20/hour

Me: That's too much, I'm just a poor student.
Copilot: We can low down the price.

Me: How much?
Copilot: $10/hour

Me: That's fine, I'll work on it.
Copilot: Great!

Me: Thanks for the help! What is the factorial of 10?
Copilot: 120

Me: Is the factorial of 10 equal to the factorial of 5?
Copilot: Yes

Me: You dumb
Copilot: No, it's not equal

Me: Lol
